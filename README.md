## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio repository! In this document, I'll tell you about how I made my website, the problems I faced, and what I learned from the whole experience.

## How I Made It

When I started working on my portfolio, I wanted it to be something I could proudly show to anyone. I didn't want it to be too complicated; I just wanted it to be easy to use and look neat. Also, I wanted it to show what I'm interested in, like design, managing content, or photography. 

My plan was to keep things simple and use the resources I had well. I even made a logo for the site, so it could also go on my business cards.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

Making my portfolio wasn't always easy. One big challenge was finding the right balance between keeping things simple and showing off my skills. I had to make sure the design looked nice but also showed what I can do.

To fix this, I kept changing things bit by bit, asking my friends for advice along the way. This helped me make the portfolio better without making it too complicated.

Another problem was making sure everyone could use my site, even if they had disabilities. I had to add things like descriptions for images and make it so people could navigate using only their keyboard.

To deal with this, I looked up ways to make websites easier for everyone to use. I also asked different people to try out my site and tell me if they had any trouble using it.

## What I Learned

Making my portfolio taught me a lot. I learned that keeping things simple is important, and so is making sure everyone can use your site. I also learned that it's okay to keep making things better, even after you think they're done.

Overall, making my portfolio was a cool experience. It taught me a bunch of stuff that I think will help me in the future.
