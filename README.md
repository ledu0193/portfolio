## How I Made It

Creating my portfolio was driven by a desire for simplicity and elegance. I aimed to showcase my skills while ensuring ease of use for visitors. From design to content management and photography, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my interests and capabilities. Additionally, I crafted a unique logo for branding consistency across various platforms, including business cards.

Another challenge was ensuring accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. Implementing features like image descriptions and keyboard navigation was crucial. Researching accessibility best practices and gathering user feedback enabled me to create a more inclusive website experience.
