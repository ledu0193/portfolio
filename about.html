            Hello as you know my name is Malachi Leduc. I’m a digital designer / photographer. I’m a male 19 and goes by He/Him pronouns. I strive to be able to capture moments of joy on my camera, explore new places, and meet new people.  What pushed me to become what i am is that i didn't want a normal conventional job i wanted something that would allow me to express myself.
