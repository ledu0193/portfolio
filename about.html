            Hello as you know my name is Malachi Leduc. I’m a Digital Designer / Photographer/ Content Creator. I’m a
            male 19 and goes by He/Him pronouns. I strive to be able to capture moments of joy on my camera, explore new
            places, and meet new people. What pushed me to become what i am is that i didn't want a normal conventional
            job i wanted something that would allow me to express myself.
        </p>
